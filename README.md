LMS is a.... //TODO
will be a cross-plattform system that allows easy module-handling and sharing.

###Getting Started
//TODO links and more
  * [Have a look at the wiki](https://github.com/Phibedy/LMS/wiki)
  * Work with it
    * Get source
    * Check out usefull modules
    * Write own modules
  * Contribute

###Featured Libraries
 * [Sockets (Client & Server)](https://github.com/Phibedy/SocketConnection)
 * Ogre-Support (Work in progress)
 * BlueTooth-Adapter (not implemented yet)
 * OpenCV (not implemented yet)
 * Audio

   * text to speech

###License
  LMS is licensed under [Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)

###TODO
  * If first version is finished -> Exclude modules for testing
  * More docs
  * License
   * Add license-header to files
   * Add contributer-agreement-file
  * arduino-support :)


###Known bugs
  * Signalhandler doesn't work properly
  * Doesn't fully work on windows (it compiles)

###Thoughts:
  * We could use [Boost] http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_57_0/index.html
  * Maybe it's we should generate the loadConfig from the CMakeLists of modules (Don't think it would be worth the effort atm)

###Special thanks go to
  *  ngladitz from #cmake, who helped me a lot getting into cmake :)
